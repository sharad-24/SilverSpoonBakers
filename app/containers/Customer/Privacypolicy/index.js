        <strong>Personal information we collect</strong>
        <span>&nbsp;</span>
        <br />
        <span>
          When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information
          about your device, including information about your web br /owser, IP
          address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your

          about the individual web pages or products that you view, what
          websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information
          about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this
          automatically-collected information as “Device Information”.&nbsp;
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          We collect Device Information using the following technologies:&nbsp;
        </span>
        <br />
        <span>
          - “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer
          and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information
          about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
          http://www.allaboutcookies.org.&nbsp;
        </span>
        <br />
        <span>
          - “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data
          including your IP address, br /owser type, Internet service provider,
          referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.&nbsp;
        </span>
        <br />
        <span>
          - “Web beacons”, “tags”, and “pixels” are electronic files used to
          record information about how you br /owse the Site.&nbsp;
        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase

        </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we
          are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.&nbsp;
        </span>

        <br />
        <strong>How do we use your personal information?</strong>
        <span>&nbsp;</span>

          We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any
          orders placed through the Site (including processing your payment
          information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices
          and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order
          Information to:&nbsp;
        </span>
        <br />
        <span>- Communicate with you;&nbsp;</span>
        <br />
        <span>- Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and&nbsp;</span>

          potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more
          generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating
          analytics about how our customers br /owse and interact with the Site,
          and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising
          campaigns).&nbsp;
