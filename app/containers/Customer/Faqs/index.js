        <strong>When and how can I cancel an order?</strong>

        You can cancel an order ,by contacting our customer support team. <br />

        <strong>Order cancellation Policy</strong> <br />
        <br />
        For orders which are cancelled 48 hours prior to delivery, we retain the
        50% deposit amount. For orders cancelled or not picked thereafter, we
        retain full amount. <br />
        <br />
        Guest can choose for full refund - deposited in bank account Or credit
        note from TCT in case of cancellation 3 days or earlier prior to the
        delivery date.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Why is there an order cancellation fee?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        We charge an order cancellation fee to compensate for the slot, time and
        effort incurred towards processing an order.
        <br />
        <br />
        Every order placed has to undergo a system driven process as well as a
        manual process in order to make sure the order reaches our customers on
        time, every time. For this purpose, a slot is booked for every order
        that gets placed in our system and the order picking process happens
        seamlessly. In this entire process we incur labor as well as an
        opportunity cost on the booked slot. During the event of a cancellation
        the entire process has to be stopped and reset. This takes up
        considerable processing time to open the slot yet again for another
        customer to order.
